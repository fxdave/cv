    <p>I'm an enthusiastic full-stack web developer with more than seven years of experience.</p>
    <p>
        I'm precise all the time because I know the wrong code will be a pain later. 
        So I'm trying to make the best code, the best architecture, and also the best documentation all the time.
    </p>
    <p>I know countless different kinds of technologies, so learning another is just getting familiar with writing things differently.
        In addition, I have experience not just in technologies but also in applying design patterns and programming conventions.
    </p>
    <p>
        As far as contributing concerns, I published several libraries and helped others with forming issues and with pull requests. 
        I'm always helping others getting their jobs done.
